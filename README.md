# Rust CLI Template

Template for creating Rust-based CLI tools.

Leverages [clap](https://clap.rs/) which provides most of the awesomeness and [structopt](https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt) to parse command line args using a struct.  Includes examples of how to provide custom error messages and run tests against the built CLI.

Inpsired by examples from [Full Stack Rust](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-rust) by Andy Weiss.
